                Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The
                objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high
                mounted to a backboard at each end.
                <br>
                A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal
                scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two
                points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one
                point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of
                the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation.
                The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or
                running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to
                carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.

                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular
                in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places
                include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically
                American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league
                or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football
                codes.

                Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between
                two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
                strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The
                object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid
                return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player
                will.
                <br>
                Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be
                played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated
                in Birmingham, England
                <br>
                Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport.
                The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the "Majors") are especially popular: the
                Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on
                grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts.
